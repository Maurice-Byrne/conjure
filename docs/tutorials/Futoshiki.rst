n x n board where each column and row is filled with the unique numbers from 1 to n (Similar to a sudoku).
But there are less than and greater than operators between cells indicating that one cell has to be filled with a number grater than (or less than) than the cell on the other side of the operator.

We model the n x n board by taking a n (given n int)
