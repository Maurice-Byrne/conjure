Set environment variable `EDITOR` to a preferred editor if the default `vi` is not a good choice, then run
```
brew edit --cask conjure.rb
```
and save the file. This puts the cask in the caskroom of the brew installation.

Next run `brew install conjure` to copy Conjure, Savile Row and a bunch of solvers to your path.

Todo
